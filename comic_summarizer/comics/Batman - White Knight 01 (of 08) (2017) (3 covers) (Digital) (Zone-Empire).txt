Batman: White Knight #1 begins with Batman brutally apprehending the Joker at Arkham Asylum. A flashback reveals an earlier, destructive chase through Gotham where the Joker, in a moment of lucidity amidst the chaos, taunts Batman about their codependent "performance." Enraged, Batman violently beats the Joker and force-feeds him an experimental pill, an act controversially recorded by Batgirl. Following this, the Joker, now calling himself Jack Napier, appears to be completely sane and physically recovered. He quickly gains public sympathy, leveraging his transformation to expose Batman's reckless vigilantism and the GCPD's complicity in the city's destruction. Napier announces his intention to sue Batman and the GCPD, declaring that he will be Gotham's new "White Knight," believing he can save the city more effectively and lawfully than the Dark Knight.
