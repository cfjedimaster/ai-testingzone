This comic book presents a collection of speculative tales. The first, "Our Green-Eyed Princess of Dumbrille!", introduces the naive Princess Dorinda, who unwittingly grants power to her envious jester, Grune. After his treachery is exposed and he is imprisoned, a transformative vision of the forgiving princess leads Grune to sincere repentance and a new, loyal devotion. Following this, "The Beautiful and the Dumb!" depicts manager George's infatuation with the untalented ventriloquist Fifi, only for him to discover she is bound by a manipulative "life-long contract" to her agent, Henri, revealing a cynical world beneath the glamour. Next, "A Hole in the Sky!" plunges Detective Paul Andrews into an investigation of a green-skinned, shape-shifting alien who, impervious to bullets, mocks humanity before transforming into a flying saucer and departing. The final visual story, "Space is a Secret," chronicles the journey of the Argonaut-I crew, who encounter a powerful, fiery woman and a mysterious alien Queen who subtly asserts control over free will, hinting at profound cosmic truths. Additionally, the comic includes a text-only science fiction story, "The Dreadful Vision," detailing a scientist's premonition regarding a woman from Earth and the future of human space exploration.
