This comic book features four distinct tales. "The Phantom Express" follows Vance Jackson, a man tormented by his conscience after plotting with his partner, Bill Porter, to steal securities. He experiences a vivid, nightmarish "dream" of the Phantom Express and his partner's betrayal, which he interprets as a warning; however, he soon discovers that Bill was awake and cunningly orchestrated the entire charade to trick Vance into confessing, then absconded with the stolen funds, leaving Vance to take the fall. In "The Bedeviled Vault!", Inspector Curan investigates a bizarre bank robbery involving a goat found in a vault. He uncovers an intricate scheme by Vice-President Thornton Hartshorn and his twin brother, Jim Watts, who used the goat as a diversion while trying to frame Hartshorn as an innocent bystander, only for their "simple" plan to unravel. "Ballast of Gold" recounts the tragic true story of the steamship "Marine" and its ill-fated voyage in 1867, laden with two million dollars in gold and over a thousand souls; caught in a catastrophic storm, the ship sinks, with its honorable Captain Hernoon choosing to go down with his vessel. Finally, "When the Sea Goes Dry!" sees two treasure hunters, Deke and Margot, led by a mysterious guide named Pedro, pursuing legendary Aztec gold in the Caribbean, only to encounter a monstrous octopus and a volcanic eruption. They ultimately realize that Pedro is a guardian of the gold, orchestrating the "curse" and the octopus's attacks to protect his ancestors' treasure, before disappearing as a new mountain rises from the sea.
