Hi Raymond Camden,

Just wanted to drop in and give you the big news: Polls are now live on Buy Me a Coffee.

To create a poll, go to your studio, select Posts and you will see an option to create Polls.

You can use Polls to engage with your audience, get ideas on what you should create next, collect feedback, and what not. Excited for you to try it out.

If you have any feedback for us, LMK. I read every reply :)

Regards,
Aleesha

And in case you‚Äôre wondering‚Ä¶ 

What is Essential Pest Concentrate?

Fights 46 Household Insect Species
Essential Pest Concentrate is a bug-killing formula designed to help fight ants, roaches, fleas, ticks, bed-bugs, and more.

It contains ZERO harsh chemicals.

Instead, its power comes from two of Mother Nature‚Äôs most potent essential oils, clove oil & cottonseed oil, both of which are deadly to bugs ‚Äî but NOT to humans.

That‚Äôs why, when used as directed, Essential Pest Concentrate is SAFE to use around kids and pets.

Safe Around Kids & Pets - when used as directed.
Click here now to Buy 3, Get 3 FREE

Plus, you can use it anywhere‚Ä¶ 

Effective for All Areas of the House
And it‚Äôs easy to use.

Simply mix Essential Pest Concentrate with 27 oz. of cold water and pour it into the reusable spray bottle. Then just give it a good shake and you‚Äôre ready to go.

Effective for All Areas of the House
But the real question is‚Ä¶

Does it work?

Of course the answer is a resounding YES!

Here‚Äôs what one happy customer shared with us:

‚ÄúEssential Pest Concentrate was miraculous! I had tried many things in an attempt to get rid of roaches, including a very expensive exterminator. I didn't really expect it to work, as the infestation had gone on for almost a year and nothing worked. I can still hardly believe it, but the little (and not so little) brown ones are GONE!! Thank you, Essential Pest Concentrate!!‚Äù
‚Äì Barrett C., Verified Buyer

That‚Äôs just one example of many.
